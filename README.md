Sort Images by Resolution
=========================

Small utility to sort images by resolution and nothing more.

Codebase is very old and unmaintained (and even do not supposed to). It is published to GitHub just for the sake of history. It was initially written in 2011 using Qt 4 and later was ported to Qt 5 in 2016. This repo just was imported from private Mercurial repo created at the "porting to Qt 5" time (unfortunately, the are no original Qt 4 sources from 2011 in the history).

This is the first useful (not aka "student's project" or something "just to learn") application I ever wrote.
